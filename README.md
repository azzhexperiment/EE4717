# NTU EE4717 Web Application Design
Project source code. If you chance upon it, feel free to reference but no warranty issued. Also, don't be stupid enough to fork it - you'll be murdered by Turnitin (140 pages of code in .docx for submission, you don't want that).

You might find writing your own code easier too, although I pactice BEM, standardjs and PSR-12 for code readability, together with extensive inline source documentation.

Reason for sharing this project is really because I find most of this project a waste of time. For a 2 AU module, the time commitment for this project is ridiculously disproportionate. So study the structure and use it as a scaffold for your own. Move on with life.

Lastly, the final examination of this module promotes KISS and brainless regurgitation of the lecture content. Best practices and industry standards are non-existent. The PHP version used is so obsolete, you can't even find hosted documentation for it.

So, yeah. I don't feel bad at all spreading my answers for this module. Check out the tutorial exercise answers at https://github.com/azzhexperiment/EE4717-course-work

### Note

Install your own dependencies. I use standardjs, webpack and sass in this project.
